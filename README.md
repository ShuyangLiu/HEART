# HololensSR
This is our final project for the Human Computer Interaction Class (CSC 212). We have used the augmented reality technology
to improve the stroke rehabilitation. More specifically, we used Hololens to implement a virtual arm to reform the neuron 
connection between brain and the disabled arm. 

Technology: Unity, Blender, Visual Studio(C#)

Team Member: Viet-Duy Nguyen, Michael Parrish, Charlie Norvell, Longze Zhang, and Adam Struhl
